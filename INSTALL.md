## INSTALL: Building Plugins generic README.

Install build dependencies as described in the
[wiki](https://github.com/Rasbats/managed_plugins/wiki/Local-Build)
Then clone this repository, enter it and make
`rm -rf build; mkdir build; cd build`.

A "normal" (not flatpak) tar.gz tarball which can be used by the new plugin
installer available from OpenCPN 5.2.0 is built using:

    $ cmake ..
    $ make tarball

To build the flatpak tarball:

    $ cmake ..
    $ make flatpak

On most platforms besides flatpak: build a platform-dependent legacy
installer like a NSIS .exe on Windows, a Debian .deb package on Linux
and a .dmg image for MacOS:

    $ cmake ..
    $ make pkg

#### Building on windows (MSVC)
On windows, a different workflow is used:

    > cmake -T v141_xp -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" --config RelWithDebInfo  ..
    > cmake --build . --target tarball --config RelWithDebInfo

This is to build the installer tarball. Use _--target pkg_ to build the
legacy NSIS installer.
